> These instructions should help to install PyQt5.

> The library is great, but really finicky to install.

> Please follow the below instructions.

1. python3 -m venv env
2. source venv/bin/activate
3. pip3 install pyqt-builder

> Go to https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/#files and download "PyQt5-5.14.2.tar.gz

> cd to the folder where you have downloaded the tar file.

4. tar -xvzf PyQt5-5.14.2.tar.gz
5. cd PyQt5-5.14.2
6. sip-install

> Be prepared to wait half a year for the PyQt5 to install.

7. pip3 install pyqt5-sip

**You should be done now.**
> To verify you have installed PyQt5 correctly, run:
- python3 coms_hub.py
